left off: need to make certificates get copied into the correct locationon the
	nginx container.  Finish getting ssl working.

[] Need to stop the fact that docker opens port to mongodb
[] Eliminate evn variables after containers are fully running
[] Make non-root user within dockers


SSL/TLS Certificate:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
location of ssl/tls cert: /etc/letsencrypt/live/aventamedia.com/fullchain.pem
cert expiry: 2017-10-16

LOCATION OF DIFFIE-HELMAN GROUP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem

Differences between prod and dev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - prod does not use hot reloading, dev does
 - prod has NODE_ENV=production, dev has NODE_ENV=development
 - prod docker image builds node, whereas dev container builds node
 - prod runs node using ps2, dev runs it directly
 - prod runs node on container startup, dev starts container, then attaches
   by exec and runs node in a terminal so it can be restarted easily
 - prod and dev load different dumps into mongoDB after starting it 
 - both dev and prod node image have app files copied in, but dev container also
   mounts app files as a volume so code edits will be seen by the container


Create self-signed cert for dev
- needed to answer questions during certificate creation manually
	-- can I get that to work non-interactively?
- used the gist to map *.dev to localhost
- had to accept the security exception in browsers
- Will the dev certificate work now?
