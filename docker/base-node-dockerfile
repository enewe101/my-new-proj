# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update

# Because of a name collision, the "node" command gets called "nodejs" on Ubuntu.  
# Force it to be "node" so that npm commands work properly.
RUN ln -s `which nodejs` /usr/local/bin/node

# Copy the code for the app into the container and build it.  First, only copy
# the package.json and run `npm install`, that way changes to app code don't cause 
# this step to repeat unless they alter dependencies
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json /usr/src/app
RUN npm install --quiet

# Now copy all the rest of the files and build the app
COPY . /usr/src/app

# Configure nginx to serve the app
RUN cp nginx-config /etc/nginx/sites-available/react-webpack-boiler
RUN ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/react-webpack-boiler /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 80 443

# A this point, the app itself still needs to be built, and then 
# At container runtime, the reverse-proxy should be restarted, and the app
# itself should be started.  This is carried out differently for production vs.
# for development.
